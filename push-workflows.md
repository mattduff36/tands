# Push Workflows

This repository has two push workflows:

## Quick Push (No Checks)

- Use for small, quick edits
- Bypasses all pre-commit checks
- Instant push to GitHub

## Checked Push (Light Checks)

- Use for larger development changes
- Runs light formatting checks (Prettier only)
- Good for ensuring code consistency
