2. Complete business verification
3. Get your API keys from the Dashboard

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env.local` file with these variables:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
# Get these from your Stripe Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys

# TEST MODE (for testing - keys start with pk_test_ and sk_test_)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here

# LIVE MODE (when ready to go live - keys start with pk_live_ and sk_live_)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_publishable_key_here
# STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_secret_key_here

# Webhook secret (get this when you create a webhook endpoint)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

### Step 3: Setup Stripe Webhooks

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Set endpoint URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/payments/webhook`
4. Select these events:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `payment_intent.canceled`
5. Copy the webhook signing secret to your `.env.local`

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Use Stripe test card numbers:
   - **Success:** `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - **Decline:** `4000 0000 0000 0002`
   - **Require 3D Secure:** `4000 0025 0000 3155`
